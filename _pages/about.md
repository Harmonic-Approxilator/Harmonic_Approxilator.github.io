# About me 
My name is Hakim and I'm a PhD student in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics at the university of Orl√©ans under the supervision of Alessandro Spallicci. I originally did my masters degree in Mathematical Physics in my hometown of Oran (Algeria).

# Research interests 
I am currently working on Non-Maxwellian (or extended) theories of electrodynamics, which includes non-linear extensions, Lorentz Symmetry (LoSy) violations as well as other inhomogeneous additions to electrodynamics.
The main focus of my thesis is to see whether certain extensions of electrodynamics could give rise to new observable phenomena at astrophysical and cosmological scales, notably massive models. 
The secondary direction of my work is to see how massive polarisations could arise in extended models, especially non-linear theories. This very often leads us to deal with the definition of mass, and how it can be reinterpreted.
The question of mass and its definition is a topic I find really interesting and it brings me to deal with gravitation and certain aspects of group theory.
To a broader extent I am also interested in understanding at a more fundamental level what is electrodynamics, and what is ( and isn't) permitted when trying to extend it formally.
I'm also extremely interested in topics of General Relativity, Classical and Quantum Field Theory, as well as some topics in mathematical physics and mathematics.

## Other hobbies
In my free time, I like to read comics play video game and enjoy good coffee. I also have been practicing Muay thai for some years now semi regularly.
